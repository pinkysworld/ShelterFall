    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How do I restore my "Remove Ads" purchase?</h3>
      <p>Open the game, go to Settings, and tap "Restore Purchases." Make sure you're signed in with the same Apple ID you used for the original purchase. The ads will be removed automatically once the purchase is verified.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>I lost my game progress. Can I recover it?</h3>
      <p>Game progress is stored locally on your device. If you've deleted and reinstalled the app, or switched to a new device, your save data may not be recoverable. We recommend keeping regular iCloud device backups to preserve your game data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>The game is crashing. What should I do?</h3>
      <p>Try these steps: (1) Force-close the app and reopen it. (2) Restart your device. (3) Make sure you're running the latest version of iOS. (4) Update to the latest version of Shelter Fall from the App Store. If the issue persists, email us with your device model and iOS version.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How does the difficulty system work?</h3>
      <p>Shelter Fall has four difficulty levels: Easy (6 starting survivors), Normal (5), Hard (3), and Apocalypse (2). Higher difficulties mean fewer survivors, scarcer resources, and tougher enemies. We recommend starting on Easy to learn the mechanics before trying harder modes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What is meta-progression?</h3>
      <p>Meta-progression is a system that lets you unlock permanent bonuses that carry across runs. Even when your shelter falls, you earn progress toward upgrades that provide small advantages in future runs. This means every playthrough contributes to your overall progression.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Is the game playable without buying anything?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. Shelter Fall is fully playable for free with no paywalls. The only in-app purchase is an optional "Remove Ads" option for $3.99. There are no pay-to-win mechanics — every player has the same gameplay experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Does the game require an internet connection?</h3>
      <p>No. Shelter Fall is fully playable offline. An internet connection is only needed to display ads (if you haven't purchased the Remove Ads option) and to process in-app purchases.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What devices are supported?</h3>
      <p>Shelter Fall requires iOS 17.0 or later. It runs on iPhone and iPad.</p>

    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <span class="updated">Last updated: June 2025</span>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Shelter Fall ("we", "our", or "the app") handles information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
    <p>Shelter Fall does not require account creation, login, or registration. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
      <li>Location data</li>
      <li>Contacts or address book data</li>
      <li>Photos, camera, or microphone data</li>
      <li>Health or fitness data</li>
      <li>Financial information (beyond what Apple processes for in-app purchases)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Game Data Stored Locally</h3>
    <p>Shelter Fall stores your game progress, settings, and preferences locally on your device using standard iOS storage mechanisms (UserDefaults and local files). This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any server.</p>

    <h3>In-App Purchases</h3>
    <p>Shelter Fall offers an optional in-app purchase to remove advertisements. All purchase transactions are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your payment information.</p>

    <h2>2. Advertising</h2>
    <p>Shelter Fall displays advertisements through Google AdMob. If you have not purchased the "Remove Ads" option, AdMob may collect certain information to serve relevant ads. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device identifiers (IDFA, when you grant permission)</li>
      <li>IP address</li>
      <li>General device information (model, OS version)</li>
      <li>Ad interaction data (impressions, clicks)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Before any tracking occurs, Shelter Fall will request your permission through Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. You can choose to allow or deny tracking. If you deny tracking, AdMob will serve non-personalized ads.</p>
    <p>For more information about how Google handles data, please review the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>3. App Tracking Transparency</h2>
    <p>On iOS 14.5 and later, Shelter Fall uses Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework to request your permission before accessing the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA). This identifier is used solely for ad personalization by Google AdMob.</p>
    <p>You can change your tracking preference at any time in your device's Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Shelter Fall uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> — For serving advertisements. <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a></li>
      <li><strong>Apple App Store / StoreKit</strong> — For processing in-app purchases. <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Shelter Fall is rated 12+ and is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information through a third-party service integrated in the app, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect personal data, there is no data retention policy on our part. Game data stored locally on your device persists until you delete the app or clear its data through iOS Settings.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>All game data is stored locally on your device and protected by iOS's built-in security features, including device encryption and app sandboxing.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect or store any personal data on our servers, there is no personal data for us to provide, modify, or delete. You can delete all locally stored game data by uninstalling the app.</p>
    <p>For data collected by third-party services (Google AdMob), please refer to their respective privacy policies for information about your rights.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
